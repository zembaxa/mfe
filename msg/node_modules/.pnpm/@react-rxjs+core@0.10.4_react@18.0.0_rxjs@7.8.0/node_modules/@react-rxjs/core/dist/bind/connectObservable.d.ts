/**
 * Accepts: An Observable.
 *
 * Returns [1, 2]
 * 1. A React Hook that yields the latest emitted value of the observable
 * 2. A `sharedLatest` version of the observable. It can be used for composing
 * other streams that depend on it. The shared subscription is closed as soon as
 * there are no subscribers to that observable.
 *
 * @param observable Source observable to be used by the hook.
 *
 * @remarks If the Observable doesn't synchronously emit a value upon the first
 * subscription, then the hook will leverage React Suspense while it's waiting
 * for the first value.
