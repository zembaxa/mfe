/**
 * Accepts: A factory function that returns an Observable.
 *
 * Returns [1, 2]
 * 1. A React Hook function with the same parameters as the factory function.
 *  This hook will yield the latest update from the observable returned from
 *  the factory function.
 * 2. A `sharedLatest` version of the observable generated by the factory
 *  function that can be used for composing other streams that depend on it.
 *  The shared subscription is closed as soon as there are no subscribers to
 *  that observable.
 *
 * @param getObservable Factory of observables. The arguments of this function
 *  will be the ones used in the hook.
 *
 * @remarks If the Observable doesn't synchronously emit a value upon the first
 * subscription, then the hook will leverage React Suspense while it's waiting
 * for the first value.
